1. User receives the Nomination email and agrees to Review and then create an access.
2. User clicks a link to the ReviewUserDeederServlet. The Servlet fetches UD Id and forwards the control to the faces/view/ReviewUserDeederDetails.xhtml page
3. This page prompts the User to start the flow - ReviewUserDeeder
4. The Deeder details are loaded in MBean and all the data is made available for update-that includes Email as well. Country is not editable though.Q- WHAT IF THE USER OPTS TO CHANGE THE EMAIL?
5. After validation and ReviewConfirm.xhtml the Deeder details are persisted in the DB. (submitDetails method)
6. The Deeder is then prompted to create the Access/Login details. (CreateAccess.xhtml). validate Passwords to return null or if everything is OK, do return (step below)
7. Acknowledge.xhtml is generated from where the User will return/finish the Flow.
8. flowreturns/ReviewUserDeeder-return ends the Flow.

ALL THIS WILL DEPRECATE THE UDACCESSCONFIRM MODULE.

AS IS --------- AS IS

1. Manually invokes the Link to the ReviewUserDeederServlet with parameter.
2. Servlet forwards to faces/view/ReviewUserDeederDetails.xhtml
3. Flows started by clicking the button.
4. Page ReviewUserDeeder - validateDetails - leads to Error messaages if anything is wrong.
5. Page ReviewConfirm with options or AmendDetails (takes back to Step 4) or SubmitDetails (where Access object is created too)
6. Goes to CreateAccess
7. Enter details and validateAccess - if errors same page, else Access created and Acknowledge page is generated.

NO NEED TO GENERATE Acknowledge page. ENOUGH HAS BEEN DONE AND RETURN THE FLOW FROM HERE.
